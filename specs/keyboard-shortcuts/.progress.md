# Keyboard Shortcuts Progress

## Goal

Implement keyboard shortcuts for the log viewer:
- j/k to navigate logs
- Enter to open detail modal
- Esc to close
- / to focus search
- l to toggle live mode

Power users will love this. Minimal code, high UX impact.

## Goal Context

Interview responses from goal clarification:
- Problem: Power user efficiency - mouse-free navigation for faster log browsing
- Constraints: Must be discoverable AND must not conflict with browser/system shortcuts
- Success criteria: Tests pass and code works - basic functionality verified

## Status

- [x] Research phase
- [x] Requirements phase
- [x] Design phase
- [x] Tasks phase
- [ ] Implementation

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Create keyboard utilities module - 5e94cfc
- [x] 1.2 Add selectedIndex state and j/k navigation to page - 9e3719b
- [x] 1.3 Add selectedIndex prop to LogTable and pass to children - 16d8c8a

## Next

Task 1.4: Add visual selection highlight to LogRow

## Learnings

- Codebase uses `<svelte:document onkeydown={handler}>` for global shortcuts (modals). This is the recommended Svelte 5 pattern.
- LogTable renders both `LogRow` (desktop) and `LogCard` (mobile) - navigation must work on both.
- Page already has `selectedLog` and `showDetailModal` state - just need to add `selectedIndex` for keyboard navigation.
- SearchInput uses shadcn-svelte Input with `ref` bindable - can be focused programmatically.
- LiveToggle uses `bind:enabled` - toggling is a single state assignment.
- Existing `announceToScreenReader` utility in focus-trap.ts can be reused for accessibility.
- j/k/l are safe single-key shortcuts - no browser conflicts since browsers use modifier keys.
- Must guard against form field focus - check event.target.tagName for INPUT/TEXTAREA/SELECT.
- Quality commands: lint (`bun run lint`), check (`bun run check`), test:unit, test:component, test:e2e, build.
- SearchInput currently does NOT expose a ref - will need modification to add `ref` bindable prop for `/` shortcut.
- LiveToggle has `disabled` prop that blocks toggle when live is paused due to search - `l` shortcut must respect this.
- Selection must reset on filter change because `allLogs` array changes content - index would point to different/wrong log.
- Gmail-style boundary behavior (stop, not wrap) is the expected pattern for power users.
- Help modal (`?` shortcut) follows GitHub/Gmail pattern for discoverability - critical for new users.
- `selectedIndex` should be -1 for "no selection" state, not null, for simpler boundary checks.
- LogTable has internal `sortedLogs` derived array - selectedIndex must track position in sorted array, passed to LogTable which maps it to the correct row.
- LogRow and LogCard have identical interface structure - adding `isSelected` prop to both for consistency.
- LogDetailModal already handles Escape via its own `<svelte:document>` handler - page-level handler must check modal state to avoid conflicts.
- event.isComposing check is critical for international keyboard users with IME (Japanese, Chinese, Korean input).
- Single keyboard handler at page level is cleaner than distributed handlers - matches modal pattern and avoids prop drilling.
- scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' }) prevents unnecessary scrolling when selected item is already visible.
- Task planning: 22 total tasks across 4 phases (POC: 12, Refactoring: 3, Testing: 5, Quality Gates: 3).
- Quality checkpoints inserted every 2-3 tasks to catch type/lint issues early.
- POC phase focuses on getting all shortcuts working before adding tests - validates idea fast.
- SearchInput modification is critical path - must expose ref before / shortcut can work.
- KeyboardHelpModal follows exact same pattern as LogDetailModal for consistency.
- Filter reset logic must be added to all 4 filter handlers (search, level, time range, clear).
- Component tests needed for LogRow, LogCard, SearchInput, and KeyboardHelpModal - all have new props/behavior.
