# Go SDK Progress

## Goal

Port the existing TypeScript and Python SDKs to Go, providing all the same features so Go developers can integrate with Logwell.

## Original Request

We already have our server ready and we already have a js/ts sdk at @sdks/typescript/ and python at @sdks/python/. Now we need to port it to Go so people using that language can also use the sdk, we need all features which the typescript/python has in go.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Initialize Go module and basic structure - d13c624
- [x] 1.2 Create core types - 3bf0373
- [x] 1.3 Create error types - d84244a
- [x] 1.4 Create HTTP transport (minimal) - 0b3c6bb
- [x] 1.5 Create batch queue (minimal) - 2527758
- [x] 1.6 Create client (minimal) - 4883afb
- [x] 1.7 POC Checkpoint - Manual integration test - 2c6aad3
- [x] 2.1 Add config validation and functional options - 2c54146

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Completed Tasks (continued)
- [x] 2.2 Add all log level methods - 8daf042
- [x] 2.3 Add retry logic with exponential backoff - 53161df

## Learnings

- Both existing SDKs have identical architecture: client -> queue -> transport pattern
- API key format: `lw_[32 alphanumeric chars including - and _]`
- Ingest endpoint: `POST /v1/ingest` with Bearer token auth
- Log levels: debug, info, warn, error, fatal
- Python SDK uses snake_case for config keys, TS uses camelCase - Go will use Go conventions
- Child loggers share parent queue (important for consistent batching)
- Source location capture uses runtime introspection (Go has `runtime.Caller` which is simpler)
- Timer-based flush uses single-shot timer reset pattern, not continuous ticker
- Overflow protection drops oldest entry (FIFO queue behavior)
- Both SDKs have identical error codes: NETWORK_ERROR, UNAUTHORIZED, VALIDATION_ERROR, RATE_LIMITED, SERVER_ERROR, QUEUE_OVERFLOW, INVALID_CONFIG
- Exponential backoff formula: `min(baseDelay * 2^attempt, 10s) + 30% jitter`
- Go SDK should use functional options pattern (idiomatic Go)
- No external dependencies needed - Go stdlib sufficient for HTTP, JSON, concurrency
- Phase 1 (POC) complete - basic client works with Info() and auto-flush on batch size
- Config validation uses regexp for API key format and url.Parse for endpoint validation
- New() now returns (*Client, error) - breaking change from POC, but necessary for proper error handling

## Next
Task 2.4: Add timer-based auto-flush
