# Progress: python-sdk

## Goal
Port the TypeScript SDK at `sdks/typescript/` to Python with full feature parity. The server is ready, and we need a Python SDK so Python developers can also use the logging platform.

## Status
- Phase: Execution (Phase 3 - Testing)
- Started: 2026-01-16
- Artifacts generated: research.md, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- 36 tests written for source_location.py covering: SourceLocation dataclass (attributes, frozen/immutable, equality, repr), capture_source_location (basic functionality, frame depth 0/1/2, invalid frames returning None, edge cases like lambda/list comprehension, exception handling), integration-style tests for typical logging patterns
- 47 tests written for queue.py covering: QueueConfig construction, BatchQueue add/flush/size/shutdown, auto-flush on batch_size, timer-based flush, overflow handling, thread safety, edge cases
- Use asyncio.Event instead of threading.Event for async test coordination to avoid race conditions
- Concurrent flush prevention tested by using async events to coordinate slow_send mock
- TypeScript SDK has clean 1:1 mappable module structure to Python
- Queue uses setTimeout/clearTimeout - maps to threading.Timer in Python
- Transport uses native fetch - httpx is the modern Python equivalent
- Source location uses Error.stack - Python uses inspect.stack() which is more direct
- Child loggers share parent queue reference - same pattern works in Python
- API key regex: `^lw_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{32}$` - same in Python with `re` module
- Config defaults: batchSize=50, flushInterval=5000ms, maxQueueSize=1000, maxRetries=3
- Exponential backoff formula: `min(baseDelay * 2^attempt, 10000)` + 30% jitter
- Error codes map to enum in Python (LogwellErrorCode)
- TypedDict preferred over dataclass for zero runtime overhead on types
- Python 3.14 on macOS uses externally-managed-environment, need venv for dev
- hatchling requires README.md to exist for build
- BatchQueue uses threading.Timer with daemon=True to auto-cleanup on program exit
- _trigger_flush handles both running event loop (create_task) and sync context (asyncio.run)
- Python's inspect.stack() provides structured FrameInfo objects directly - much simpler than parsing JS Error.stack strings
- Client uses _owns_queue flag to track if it created the queue (needed for child loggers sharing parent queue)
- TYPE_CHECKING block prevents circular imports and satisfies ruff TC001 lint rule
- mypy type stubs may not support newer dataclass features like slots=True - removed for compatibility
- Thread safety was already implemented during POC - task 2.1 verified and fixed lint issues (TC001, UP035)
- UP035: Use collections.abc instead of typing for Awaitable, Callable in Python 3.9+
- Actionable error messages should include: what failed, why, and how to fix it
- API keys should be masked in error messages to avoid leaking credentials in logs
- mypy --strict passes already - type hints were comprehensive from the start
- pytest --collect-only exits 5 with no tests (expected) but fixtures load fine
- respx added for HTTP mocking in integration tests
- 39 fixtures defined covering valid/invalid configs, mock responses, sample entries
- pytest-cov installed for coverage reporting
- 78 tests written for config.py with 100% coverage
- Tests cover: validate_api_key_format (valid/invalid keys), validate_config (missing fields, invalid formats, numeric bounds), default merging, optional fields, return value structure, edge cases
- Mock urlparse to test exception handling in _is_valid_url (lines 57-58 coverage)
- 58 tests for errors module covering: LogwellErrorCode enum (7 codes, values, uniqueness), LogwellError construction, inheritance from Exception, __str__ and __repr__ methods, edge cases
